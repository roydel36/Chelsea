## Neighborhood Rankings:
Most of the rankings system rate the individual aspects of each neighborhood, such as nightlife, schooling system, affordability, housing, convenience, safety, and family-friendliness. Some of the ranking systems, such as Niche and Street Advisor, use reviews given by residents in those neighborhoods to aid in the ranking through a five star range. When rating different aspects of the neighborhood, most review systems will cite the experiences of long term residents as evidence. Some sites, such as Curbedâ€™s Walkable Neighborhoods, only focus on one quality when ranking an entire neighborhood (in this instance it is the walkability of an area, which includes bike paths, sidewalk layout, etc.).

## Most Desirable Outdoor Dining Qualities:
Accessibility - During COVID, access to open usable roadways and large walkways are essential in ensuring the ability to have a comfortable dining experience that also does not disturb other pedestrians.

Cleanliness - Sanitation is important as many restaurants because of COVID-19 have undergone extreme cleaning procedures and temperature checks are common as well.

Affordability - This is an important factor in ranking as exorbitantly high and unjustified prices does not allow many people to have access to different types of restaurants and dining experiences.

According to our research which analyzes the number of restaurants with the roadway and sidewalk seating availability within Manhattan, the West Village has the most amount of restaurants with roadway seating availability as well as sidewalk seating availability. Following the West Village in the number of restaurants with the most roadway seating availability are Midtown, Soho, the East Village, then Chelsea. Additionally, following the West Village in the number of restaurants with the most sidewalk seating availability are Midtown, East Village, Chelsea, then Soho. These rankings reflect the research done on these individual neighborhoods in Honors Assignment 2, as it was found that the West Village was known for its walkability and frequent bike stations. Since, the streets are found to be narrower in the West Village, driving is not as easy, therefore many New York natives and tourists opt to walk in the ample sidewalk space or utilize its many bike stations. Due to these less busy roads, roadway seating became more available in combination with sidewalk seating.
